* 哪些你觉得很容易？
  Answers: 
  The text content elements are relatively easy and I just need to pay attention to those special inline markup elements such as <sup> and <sub>. As the number of those formats is limited, so it is not hard for me.
* 你学到了那些新技能？
  Answers:
  I am happy to acquire another method to insert image, in which I referred to is the <figure> element. In addition, I learned another method to divide the two different parts. I put a horizontal rule in this project, while I found a 1px-height <div> element was picked to act as a line on Abcam’s website. It really opened my mind as it is better than <hr> element in a responsive page. 
* 哪些你觉得很难？
  Answers:
  As mentioned above, I feel that it is hard to code wisely. The appearance of a page can be built in different structures. Different coding have their own advantages and disadvantages. This is not easy, but makes coding amazing and challenging.

  Learning is the process to meet and to solve questions. The resources and the media should never be limited. I will keep the note, ok, that’s all.
