  <h1>My Udacity Project(P0): A Developer Mindset</h1>
  <!--Patr I: Reflections-->
  <hr />
  <p>Nowadays the web technology or the IT is developing at an incredible speed. Coding will be a basic rule that everyone should acquire in the near future. So I have no choice but only to learn. </p>
  <p>When it comes to the topic to be a web developer, I think I am ready now. I am working in a bio-tech company and I deal with data most of the time. Actually I analyze and process the marketing and sales data with Visual Basic; moreover, I write and edit the HTML code my colleagues wrote. </p>
  <p>The reason I select the Udacity course are as follows:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Interest</li>
    <li>Career designing</li>
    <li>Personal character</li>  
  </ul>
  <p>I am interest in coding when I learned the visual basic language. I like the feeling to solve the question and overcome obstacles. Secondly, I cannot imagine doing the same workflow all my life. Although data analyzing is also amazing, my work is not. I want to do some creating and challenging work and I enjoy the feeling to get something new. Coding meets my command, which has been proved in my work.</p>
  <p>As mentioned, I can edit html code but I have not put my mind to learn it systematically. This is the best start. I will meet questions and bugs but I am confident to solve them. I have modified the Wordpress plugins to avoid some sensitive tables and some template PHP files.</p>
  <p>I can calm myself down and jump out of the question when I got confused. In addition, I tend to consider the whole problem, which keeps me at a right direction. Importantly and luckily, my brain is good.</p>
  <p>Yes, come on!</p>
